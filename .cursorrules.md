# Project Context
We are building "AmethystMC," a custom Minecraft launcher website. 
- **Goal:** A high-conversion, single-page application (SPA) focused on downloading the client.
- **Aesthetic:** "Lunar Client meets Crystal Magic." Dark mode only, sleek, modern, glassmorphism, neon glows.
- **Key References:** - Structural inspiration: www.lunarclient.com (Hero placement, Feature grids)
  - Functional inspiration: bedrocklauncher.github.io (Open source, clean utility)

# Design System Rules

## 1. Color Palette (Amethyst Theme)
Refrain from using generic blues or greens. Use these exact hex codes:
- **Background Deep:** `#0a0618` (The void/deep cave)
- **Background Surface:** `#15102c` (Card background)
- **Primary Accent:** `#9966CC` (Standard Amethyst)
- **Vibrant Glow:** `#b237ff` (For hover states and gradients)
- **Text Primary:** `#f5f3f8` (Off-white for readability)
- **Text Secondary:** `#b09ecf` (Muted lavender for subtitles)
- **Border/Divider:** `rgba(153, 102, 204, 0.2)` (Low opacity crystal edge)

## 2. Typography
- **Headings:** Sans-serif, bold, tight tracking. (Recommended: 'Inter' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans').
- **Body:** Clean, legible sans-serif.
- **Style:** Headings should often have a subtle `text-shadow` or purple gradient fill.

## 3. UI/UX Principles
- **Glassmorphism:** heavily used. UI cards should look like frosted purple glass (backdrop-filter: blur(12px), bg-opacity-20).
- **One Page Flow:** 1. **Hero:** Massive "Download" CTA, 3D floating crystal or launcher screenshot.
  2. **Features:** 2x2 or 3x3 grid of glass cards.
  3. **Footer:** Simple links.
- **Buttons:** - Primary CTA must be a gradient from `#9966CC` to `#b237ff`.
  - Hover effects should include a "glow" (box-shadow: 0 0 20px #b237ff).

# Coding Standards (React/Next.js + Tailwind)

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- **Tailwind Classes:** Use utility classes for everything. Avoid custom CSS files unless doing complex animations.
- **Animation:** Use `framer-motion` for entrance animations (fade-up, scale-in).

## Specific Component Rules

### The Hero Section
- Must take up 100vh (minus navbar).
- Center alignment.
- The "Download" button must be the most visible element on the page.
- Background should feature a "mesh gradient" or "aurora" effect in deep purples.

### The Navbar
- Fixed at top, backdrop-blur-md.
- Links: Home, Features, FAQ, Source (GitHub).
- Right side: Small "Download" button (secondary variant).

### Feature Cards
- Darker purple background (`#15102c`).
- Thin purple border (`border-purple-500/20`).
- White icon on top left.
- Hover state: Slight lift (`-translate-y-1`) and border glow.

# Example Component (Button)
When asked for a button, generate this style by default:
```tsx
<button className="px-8 py-4 bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-fuchsia-600 rounded-full text-white font-bold text-lg shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(168,85,247,0.5)] hover:shadow-[0_0_25px_rgba(168,85,247,0.8)] hover:scale-105 transition-all duration-300">
  {children}
</button>
